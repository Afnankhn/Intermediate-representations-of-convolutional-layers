# Intermediate representations of convolutional layers
 This repository is the practice working and learning based on the google developers tensorflow example.
A simple convalution model is trained on the human-horse dataset and the layers are presenrted at different convalution stages of the model.
The core idea is to understand the CNN architecture.
